CS330 Module 8


When I approach software design, I think about it like managing a project. Starting with a goal, defining objectives, and then breaking down the work into achievable milestones. Working on this 3D scene helped me strengthen my ability to plan and organize the tasks in each module. I learned how important it is to set clear goals, review progress frequently, and iterate based on the results I achieve each week. These skills directly translate to effective project management which is my goal professionally. My design process followed a cycle of planning, implementation, and evaluation. I developed new technical design skills such as structuring modular code and using visual feedback to refine each component. 
From a development perspective, I approached coding with the same mindset: build in stages, test continuously, and communicate progress with comments within my code. Each module taught me how iteration strengthens both quality and efficiency. Over time, I progressed from just coding solutions to thinking critically about workflow, version control, and resource dependencies, traits essential for overseeing a development team. Looking ahead, computer science gives me a strong technical foundation that will help me better communicate with engineers, understand project scope, and lead teams effectively as a project manager.
